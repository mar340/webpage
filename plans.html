		<p>I hope to use this medium to talk about my journey through neuroscience, to share the things I've learned including building your CV, reaching out for mentorship, applying for grants, building posters, and thinking about how to use neuroscience as a tool for social justice and anti-colonial work.</p>
		<p>I'll also share resources that have been shared with, talk about experiences I've had in programs that I've applied to and been accepted into, and about the non-academic work I've engaged in at Boston University over the last few years.</p>
